# PSHTML
Module to generate HTML markup language within a DSL

# Example

PSHTML allow people to write a HTML document using powershell-like syntax, which makes building a webpage easier, and less cumbersome.

## A few Basic examples

### Basic page

```Powershell

html {

    head{

        title "woop title"
        link "css/normalize.css" "stylesheet"
    }

    body{

        Header {
            h1 "This is h1 Title in header"
            div {
                p {
                    "This is simply a paragraph in a div."
                }
            }
        }
    
        
            p {
                h1 "This is h1"
                h2 "This is h2"
                h3 "This is h3"
                h4 "This is h4"
                h5 "This is h5"
                h6 "This is h6"
                strong "plop";"Woop"
            }
    }
    
}

```


## Templates

Since version 0.4 it is possible to build websites using templates. The following example showcase how this works:

```Example04/Example04.ps1``` contains the following sample code:

### Example04/Example04.ps1

```powershell


html{
    Header{
        h1 "This is an example generated using PSHTML Templates"
    }
    Body{

        include -name Body

    }
    Footer{
        Include -Name Footer
    }
}

```

Assuming that ```Example4/body.ps1``` and ```Example/Footer.ps1``` contains the following ```pshtml```code:

### body.ps1

```powershell

    h2 "This comes from a template file"

```

### footer.ps1

```powershell
div {
    h4 "This is the footer from a template"
    p{
        "Copyright from template"
    }
}
```

Would generate the following code:

```html

    <header>
        <h1>This is an example generated using PSHTML Templates</h1>
    </header>
    <body>
        <h2>This comes from a template file</h2>
    </body>
    <footer>
        <div>
            <h4>This is the footer from a template</h4>
        </div>
    </footer>
</html>

```
## Generating a (very) basic form

```PowerShell
form "MyPage.php" post _self -Content {

    input "text" "FirstName"
    input "text" "LastName"
    input submit "MySubmit"
}
```

Which generates the following code:

```html
<form action="MyPage.php" method="post" target="_self" >
    <input type="text" name="FirstName" >
    <input type="text" name="LastName" >
    <input type="submit" name="MySubmit" >
</form>
```
# Todo List

There is a lot to accomplish before making this module available to the public. 

I plan the following most important milestones:

 - [ ] Provide basic functionality (Generating an HTML document) using the DSL. The following sections are the highest priority:
    - [X] Root
    - [ ] Sections
    - [X] Tables
    - [ ] blocs
    - [ ] Forms
    - [ ] Textual semantic

In parallel to this, I want to add the support for the following attributes (as a first step):
- [ ] Class
- [ ] Id
- [ ] Style


Eventually, the following components will also be added:
 - [ ] Scripts
 - [ ] Include Sections
 - [ ] Interactive Data

## Interactive data

- [ ] ```<detail>```
- [ ] ```<command>```
- [ ] ~~```<menu>```~~ --> This feature will not be implemented, since this feature is only avaible in Firefox.

## Function Design:


### Passing attributes

- [ ] Every HTML tag (PSHTML Function) should have 'at least' the following attributes available:
- Class
- ID
- Style

these are - in my opinion- the most commonly used attributes in HTML.

### Additional Attributes

- [ ] Each function has an additional parameter called: ```Attributes``` of type HashTable.
It will allow to add additional html tags without having to list ALL the existing attributes, and offer flexibility for custom and or special htmls attributes.
