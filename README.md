PSHTML is a cross platform Powershell module to generate HTML markup language within a DSL on Windows and Linux.

# Summary

`PSHTML` allow people to write a HTML document(s) using `powershell-like` syntax, which makes building webpages easier, and less cumbersome for 'native' PowerSheller's

`PSHTML` offers the flexibility of the PowerShell language, and allows to add logic in ```powershell``` directly in the ```HTML``` structure. This open the possibility to add loops, conditional statements, switches, functions, classes, calling external modules etc.. all that directly from the same editor.

`PSHTML` comes with template functionality which allows one to `include` parts of webpages that are identical throughout the web page Eg: footer, Header,Menu etc..

Using PSHTML, offers code completion and syntax highlighting from the the default powershell language. As PSHTML respects the W3C standards, any HTML errors, will be spotted immediately.

Since version `0.7.0` PSHTML supports the creation of charts.

# Detailed introduction

You can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiWRslFtl9A&t=1868s) , an introduction talk about `PSHTML` by `Stéphane van Gulick` which teach you in the first step everything you need to know to get started with `PSHTML` and show concret implementation examples. In the second part of the talk, Stéphane explains how one can extend PSHTML further by coupling it together with `Polaris` creating a full webserver 100% in powershell.

## A few Basic examples of what PSHTML can achieve

### Basic page

The following quick example displays a simple page, with a few headers, divs, paragraphs, and header elements

```Powershell

Import-Module PSHTML

html {

    head{

        title "woop title"
        link "css/normalize.css" "stylesheet"
    }

    body{

        h1 "This is h1 Title in header"
        div {
            p {
                "This is simply a paragraph in a div."
            }

            h1 "This is h1"
            h2 "This is h2"
            h3 "This is h3"
            h4 "This is h4"
            h5 "This is h5"
            h6 "This is h6"
            strong "plop";"Woop"
        }

        h1 "My favorites Fruits"

        $Fruits = "Apple","Banana","Orange","Ananas"

        ul {

            foreach($fruit in $Fruits){
                li {
                    $fruit
                }
            }
        }

    }
    footer {
        p{
            "Copyright 2019"
        }
    }

}

```

## A more advanced example

The following example is a tribute to PowerShell GodFather 'Jeffrey Snover' where we generated a BIO of the ShellFather gathering data from Wikipedia and other sources, all that using Powershell.

The example ```PSHTML / Powershell``` code is available [here](PSHTML/Examples/Example6/Example6.ps1)

The generated ```HTML``` code is available [here](PSHTML/Examples/Example6/Example6.html)

## Charts

With version `0.7.0` PSHTML introduced the functionality of `charting`. In `v0.8.0` this functionality has been extended and offers now a total of 7 different chart types to communicate your data to your end users, and to make your webpages look amazingly cool!
